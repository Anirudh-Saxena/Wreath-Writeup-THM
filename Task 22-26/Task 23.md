**TASK 23: Empire: Installation**

Lets move forward with the installtion..

In ages past this was a much more complicated process involving the Git repo and setup scripts. These days it's easiest to just use the apt repositories:

    sudo apt install powershell-empire starkiller

After the installtion run the command to start the Empire server 

      sudo powershell-empire server

If you want to work with the starkiller you can skip the upper process..
