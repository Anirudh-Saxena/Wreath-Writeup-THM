In this diagram, there are four machines on the target network: one public facing server, with three machines which are not exposed to the internet. 
By accessing the public server, we can then pivot to attack the remaining three targets.

Read the description once and then you are good to go..

This tasks have a lot of theory thats why better to cover in a folder instead of making a new file for this ...
