Last tool in this sectionn ufff...

This tool is different from the other tools as it doesn't uses any port forwading or proxy creation instead it uses SSH connection to create a tunnelled proxy that acts like a new interface.

In short it creates a VPN(Virtual Private Network), which allows us to divert the traffic without using proxychains...

Lets move forward with the installation of this tool..
